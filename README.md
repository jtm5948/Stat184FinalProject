# Stat184FinalProject
Introduction to R Final Project - Analysis of MLB Data

This project was completed with my partner Sonny Sweetall in our Stat 184: Introduction to R class. The project uses an R Notebook to display the data wrangling steps taken to create meaningful data tables, along with visualizations of the data and the insights we made.
